- 👋 Hi, I’m Eido Inoue. My family name was "havill" until 2010, but I still use that as an ID online as it's more unique than "inoue".
- 👀 I’m interested in free and open source software, as well as 3D IK model based animation, art and video games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on e-commerce based software and marketing technology.
- 📫 The best way to reach me online if you don't have my private email address is through LinkedIn.
